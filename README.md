# PSOI

Julia implementation of high-performace QP (quadratic program) solver for MPC (model predictive control) applications. The algorithm is based on MPRGP (Modified Proportioning with Reduced Gradient Projections) and on CGNP (Combined Gradient/Newton Projection) algorithms.

The description of the algotihm is proposed in the following paper:
 - ŠANTIN, Ondřej, et al. Proportioning with second-order information for model predictive control. Optimization Methods and Software, 2017, 32.3: 436-454, DOI: 10.1080/10556788.2016.1213840.
